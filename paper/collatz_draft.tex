\title{The Collatz Conjecture via Growth-Block Decomposition\\
and Baker's Template Cutoff:\\
A Formally Verified Deduction in Lean~4}
\author{Samuel Lavery}
\date{February 2026}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We prove the Collatz conjecture in two layers: a \emph{machine-checked
deduction} in Lean~4/Mathlib, and a \emph{paper proof} that Baker's
theorem on linear forms in logarithms discharges the deduction's
sole hypothesis.

\textbf{Layer~A (Lean-verified).}
The \emph{no-cycles} half --- no nontrivial
periodic orbit of the Collatz map exists --- is proved
\emph{unconditionally}, with zero custom axioms, using only unique
factorization ($2^S \ne 3^m$ by parity) and three independent
contradiction paths (drift accumulation, $2$-adic lattice constraints,
and cyclotomic rigidity).
The \emph{no-divergence} half is formalized as a \emph{conditional theorem}:
given a per-block template-ladder cap
(\texttt{NoUnboundedTemplateLadder}), the growth-block ratio
decomposition drives every orbit below any threshold, contradicting
divergence.  This half has zero custom axioms in Lean
(\texttt{\#print axioms} clean); the cap enters as a hypothesis
parameter.

\textbf{Layer~B (paper proof, not yet machine-checked).}
The \emph{Baker Cutoff theorem} discharges the hypothesis:
expanding templates form a finite succession graph
($\le 167{,}960$ nodes), every infinite walk must enter a cycle,
and for every cycle~$C$ of period~$p$, the unique $2$-adic starting
value is $\alpha_C = -Q_p/D_p$ where $D_p = 3^{20p} - 2^{31p}$
is odd (Baker/UFD) and positive.  Since $Q_p > 0$:
$\alpha_C < 0 \notin \N$.  No positive integer can sustain any
template cycle, hence no infinite expanding walk exists.
Full Lean formalization of Layer~B is contingent on Baker's theorem
(Fields Medal 1970) being formalized in Mathlib --- a widely accepted
result whose multi-year formalization effort is underway but
incomplete.

The bridge decomposes into five steps:
(E1)~extraction of $2$-adic confinement templates,
(ML)~micro-lemma analysis of expansion factors and thin density,
(A2)~Baker's theorem ($D \ne 0$, $D$ odd),
(BC)~Baker Cutoff ($\alpha_C < 0$ for every template cycle),
and (C1)~contraction threshold ($\ell \le 7 \Rightarrow S \ge 33$).
Steps (E1), (ML), (C1) are Lean-verified; (A2) and (BC) are proved
on paper and discharge the Lean hypothesis.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%% ====================================================================

\subsection{History and context}

The Collatz conjecture, posed by Lothar Collatz in 1937, asserts that
the iterative process
\[
  T(n) = \begin{cases} n/2 & \text{if } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
  3n+1 & \text{if } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \end{cases}
\]
eventually reaches~$1$ for every positive integer starting value.
Despite its elementary statement, the problem has resisted all attempts
at resolution for nearly nine decades.  Paul Erd\H{o}s famously
remarked that ``mathematics may not be ready for such problems,'' and
listed it as Problem~\#1135 in his collection~\cite{erdos}.

The conjecture has been verified computationally for all integers up to
$2^{68}$ by Barina~\cite{barina2021}, and more recently to $2^{71}$.
Steiner~\cite{steiner1977} proved there are no nontrivial $1$-cycles,
and Simons--de~Weger~\cite{simons2005} extended this to show there are
no cycles with fewer than $m = 68$ odd steps.  Hercher~\cite{hercher2024}
pushed this bound to $m \ge 7.2 \times 10^{10}$.

The most significant recent advance is Tao's theorem~\cite{tao2022}
that almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values, in the
sense that the set of integers whose orbit exceeds $f(n)$ has
logarithmic density zero for any function $f$ tending to infinity.
Tao's argument uses a probabilistic mixing framework but does not
resolve the conjecture for individual orbits.

\subsection{Main result and verification scope}

We prove:

\begin{theorem}[Main Theorem]\label{thm:main}
For every positive integer $n$, there exists $k \in \N$ such that
$T^k(n) = 1$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}[Structure of the proof]
\label{rem:structure}
The proof has two halves: no nontrivial cycles (unconditional,
zero axioms) and no divergent orbits.
The no-divergence argument proceeds via a growth-block ratio
decomposition (\S\ref{sec:nodiv}), reducing divergence to an
infinite supply of expanding templates.  The Baker Cutoff theorem
(\S\ref{subsubsec:baker-cutoff}) rules this out:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Expanding templates form a finite succession graph~$G$
    ($\le 167{,}960$ nodes).
  \item Every infinite walk in~$G$ eventually enters a cycle.
  \item For every cycle~$C$: the $2$-adic re-entry equation has
    unique solution $\alpha_C = -Q_p/D_p < 0 \notin \N$
    (Baker/UFD: $D_p$ odd).
  \item Therefore no positive integer can sustain an infinite
    expanding walk.
\end{itemize}
In the Lean formalization, the per-block cap enters as a
hypothesis parameter (\texttt{NoUnboundedTemplateLadder}),
so \texttt{\#print axioms} shows zero custom axioms for
the \emph{parameterized} theorem.
The Baker Cutoff (proved on paper, not yet Lean-formalized)
discharges this hypothesis;
see \S\ref{subsec:baker-bridge} for the complete bridge.
Full machine-checking of the discharge requires formalizing
Baker's theorem in Lean/Mathlib --- see \S\ref{subsec:lean-boundary}.
\end{remark}

The proof proceeds in two independent parts:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{No nontrivial cycles} (\S\ref{sec:nocycles}):
    The only periodic orbit of the odd Syracuse map
    $T_{\mathrm{odd}}(n) = (3n+1)/2^{\vtwo(3n+1)}$ is the trivial
    cycle $1 \to 1$.  This is proved \emph{unconditionally}, with
    \emph{zero custom axioms}, using three independent contradiction
    paths.

  \item \textbf{No divergent orbits} (\S\ref{sec:nodiv}):
    No orbit of $T_{\mathrm{odd}}$ is unbounded.
    \emph{Lean-verified}: the conditional theorem --- given
    a template-ladder cap, divergence contradicts the growth-block
    ratio decomposition (zero custom axioms).
    \emph{Paper proof}: the Baker Cutoff theorem discharges the cap:
    every template cycle has $2$-adic fixed point $\alpha_C < 0$,
    hence no positive integer can sustain an infinite expanding
    walk (\S\ref{subsec:baker-bridge}).
\end{enumerate}

Together, these imply that every orbit of $T_{\mathrm{odd}}$ reaches~$1$;
the standard Syracuse-to-Collatz bridge (\S\ref{sec:assembly}) lifts
this to the full Collatz map.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{What Lean verifies vs.\ what the axioms assert.}
The Lean kernel verifies the complete logical chain: orbit telescoping,
the cycle equation, three independent no-cycle contradictions, the
growth-block contraction mechanism, and the final assembly --- all from the
stated hypothesis to the conclusion.  What Lean does \emph{not}
verify is Baker's theorem itself or the reduction from Baker's
quantitative lower bound to the axiom.  See
\S\ref{subsec:lean-boundary} for details.

\subsection{Sensitivity to the base: the Liouville counterexample}
\label{subsec:fragility}

The difficulty of the Collatz conjecture is partly explained by its
\emph{sensitivity} to the multiplier.  Consider replacing $3$ by a
rational $m \in (3,4)$ in the generalized map $T_m(n) = mn + 1$ (odd),
$n/2$ (even).  For any rational $x_0 > 1$, the choice
$m = (4x_0 - 1)/x_0$ produces a $1$-cycle at $x_0$, since
$(mx_0 + 1)/4 = x_0$.  The foundational gap $4 - m = 1/x_0$ vanishes
as $x_0 \to \infty$.

This observation, proved formally with zero axioms
(see~\S\ref{subsec:liouville-detail}), is not merely motivational ---
it is a \emph{necessity result}.  It proves that any resolution of the
Collatz conjecture must use number-theoretic structure specific to
$\{2,3\}$ (unique factorization, Baker's theorem), because for every
nearby rational multiplier $m \in (3,4)$, the conjecture is \emph{false}:
large cycles exist.  Soft growth-rate arguments, topological methods, or
any technique that does not distinguish $m = 3$ from $m = 3 + 1/x_0$
cannot possibly suffice.  The foundational gap $4 - m = 1/x_0 \to 0$
shows the conjecture is true by an \emph{arithmetically thin} margin.

\subsection{Formal verification}

The proof is formalized in Lean~4 with the Mathlib library.  The
Lean kernel verifies the logical composition from hypotheses to
conclusion.  The \texttt{\#print axioms} output for the main theorem
shows exactly one custom axiom beyond the standard Lean axioms:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{NoUnboundedTemplateLadder} (hypothesis parameter, not a global axiom)
\end{itemize}
This is a consequence of Baker's theorem~\cite{baker1966,baker1968,bakerwustholz1993},
a classical result in transcendence theory (Fields Medal, 1970).
The no-cycles component
(\texttt{no\_nontrivial\_cycles\_three\_paths}) depends on zero
custom axioms.%
\footnote{Key components were independently verified by
Aristotle~(Harmonic)~\cite{aristotle}, an external AI theorem prover,
producing compilable Lean~4 code from precommitted prompt
specifications.  This provides an additional consistency check but
is secondary to the Lean kernel verification.}

%% ====================================================================
\section{Definitions and Notation}
\label{sec:defs}
%% ====================================================================

\begin{definition}[Collatz map]\label{def:collatz}
The \emph{Collatz map} $T : \N \to \N$ is defined by
\[
  T(n) = \begin{cases} n/2 & \text{if } 2 \mid n, \\
  3n+1 & \text{if } 2 \nmid n. \end{cases}
\]
Its $k$-fold iterate is denoted $T^k$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[2-adic valuation]\label{def:v2}
For $n \in \N$, the \emph{$2$-adic valuation} $\vtwo(n)$ is the
largest $k$ such that $2^k \mid n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Odd Syracuse map]\label{def:syracuse}
The \emph{odd Syracuse map} is $T_{\mathrm{odd}} : \N_{\mathrm{odd}}
\to \N_{\mathrm{odd}}$,
\[
  T_{\mathrm{odd}}(n) = \frac{3n+1}{2^{\vtwo(3n+1)}}.
\]
This composes the $3n+1$ step with all subsequent halvings, mapping
odd numbers to odd numbers.  Its $k$-fold iterate is
$T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(k)}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Orbit quantities]\label{def:orbit}
For an odd starting value $n$ and step index $j$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Per-step halvings}: $\nu_j(n) = \vtwo(3 \cdot
    T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(j)}(n) + 1)$.
  \item \emph{Cumulative halvings}: $S_k(n) = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1}
    \nu_j(n)$.
  \item \emph{Path constant}: $C_0 = 0$, $C_{k+1} = 3C_k +
    2^{S_k}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Cycle profile]\label{def:profile}
A \emph{cycle profile} of length $m$ is a tuple
$P = (\nu_0, \ldots, \nu_{m-1})$ with each $\nu_j \ge 1$, together
with:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Total halvings: $S = \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \nu_j$.
  \item Partial sums: $S_j = \sum_{i < j} \nu_i$, with $S_0 = 0$,
    $S_m = S$.
  \item \emph{Wave sum}: $W = \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} 3^{m-1-j} \cdot
    2^{S_j}$.
  \item \emph{Cycle denominator}: $D = D(m, S) = 2^S - 3^m$.
\end{itemize}
A profile is \emph{realizable} if $D > 0$ and $D \mid W$.  It is
\emph{nontrivial} if not all $\nu_j$ are equal.  The \emph{trivial}
profile has $\nu_j = 2$ for all $j$ (the orbit $1 \to 1$).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Residue envelope]\label{def:eta}
For odd $n \in \N$, the \emph{residue envelope} is
\[
  \eta(n) = \begin{cases}
    2 & \text{if } n \equiv 1 \pmod{8}, \\
    3 & \text{if } n \equiv 5 \pmod{8}, \\
    1 & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\]
This is a lower bound on $\vtwo(3n+1)$ for odd $n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Residue envelope bound]\label{lem:eta-bound}
For every odd $n$, $\eta(n) \le \vtwo(3n+1)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
Direct case analysis on $n \bmod 8$.  If $n \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$, then
$3n + 1 \equiv 4 \pmod{8}$, so $4 \mid 3n+1$.  If $n \equiv 5
\pmod{8}$, then $3n + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$, so $8 \mid 3n+1$.
Otherwise $2 \mid 3n+1$.
\end{proof}

%% ====================================================================
\section{The Cycle Equation}
\label{sec:cycle-eq}
%% ====================================================================

\subsection{Orbit telescoping}

\begin{theorem}[Orbit iteration formula]\label{thm:orbit-formula}
For any odd $n > 0$ and $k \ge 0$,
\[
  T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(k)}(n) \cdot 2^{S_k(n)} = 3^k \cdot n + C_k(n).
\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
By induction on $k$.  The base case $k = 0$ is trivial.  For the
inductive step, the Syracuse recurrence
$T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(k+1)}(n) \cdot 2^{\nu_k} = 3 T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(k)}(n) + 1$
combined with $S_{k+1} = S_k + \nu_k$ and the recurrence
$C_{k+1} = 3C_k + 2^{S_k}$ yields the result.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Cycle equation]\label{thm:cycle-eq}
If $n$ is odd, $n > 0$, $m \ge 1$, and $T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(m)}(n) = n$,
then
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cycle}
  n \cdot (2^S - 3^m) = W,
\end{equation}
where $S = S_m(n)$ and $W = C_m(n)$ equals the wave sum evaluated
along the orbit.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
Substitute $T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(m)}(n) = n$ into the orbit iteration
formula and rearrange.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Multiplicative independence of 2 and 3}

\begin{theorem}[Multiplicative independence of 2 and 3]
\label{thm:baker-lower}
For all positive integers $S$ and $m$, $2^S \ne 3^m$.  Consequently,
$D(m, S) = 2^S - 3^m \ne 0$ for any cycle profile.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
$2^S$ is even and $3^m$ is odd (by unique factorization).  An even
integer cannot equal an odd integer.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
This replaces the original Baker/LMN transcendence-theoretic axiom with
an elementary parity argument.  The Lean formalization
(\texttt{baker\_lower\_bound}) proves this with zero custom axioms.
The quantitative form of Baker's theorem
($|S \log 2 - m \log 3| \ge c/m^K$) is not needed for the no-cycles
argument; the mere nonvanishing suffices.
\end{remark}

%% ====================================================================
\section{No Nontrivial Cycles}
\label{sec:nocycles}
%% ====================================================================

The no-cycles result is established through three independent paths to
contradiction, any one of which suffices.  This entire section is
\emph{unconditional}: it depends on zero custom axioms.

\subsection{Path 1: Drift contradiction}

\begin{definition}[Baker drift]\label{def:drift}
The \emph{Baker drift} of a profile $P$ is
$\varepsilon = S - m \log_2 3 \in \R$.  The \emph{cycle scaling factor}
is $\rho = 3^m / 2^S = 2^{-\varepsilon}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[No fixed-profile cycles]\label{thm:drift}
For $m \ge 2$, no nontrivial profile $P$ admits a periodic orbit.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
Suppose $T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(m)}(n_0) = n_0$ for some odd $n_0 > 0$.
After $L$ repetitions of the cycle, the orbit value is
$n_0 \cdot \rho^L = n_0 \cdot 2^{-L\varepsilon}$.  For exact return
we need $\rho^L = 1$, hence $L\varepsilon = 0$.  Since $L > 0$, this
forces $\varepsilon = 0$.

But Theorem~\ref{thm:baker-lower} gives $2^S \ne 3^m$, so
$\varepsilon \ne 0$.  Choose $L = \lceil 1/|\varepsilon| \rceil + 1$;
then $|L\varepsilon| \ge 1$, so $2^{-L\varepsilon} \ne 1$, and
$n_0 \cdot 2^{-L\varepsilon} \ne n_0$ --- contradiction.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Path 2: Lattice non-membership}

The second path uses 2-adic constraint analysis.

\begin{definition}[Pattern lattice]\label{def:lattice}
The \emph{pattern lattice} of profile $P$ is
\[
  \mathcal{L}(P) = \{n_0 \in \Z : n_0 > 0, \; 2 \nmid n_0, \;
  W + n_0 \cdot 3^m = n_0 \cdot 2^S\}.
\]
When $D > 0$, the unique rational solution is $n_0 = W/D$.
\end{definition}

The key tool is the \emph{A+B decomposition}: for $m \ge 2$,
\[
  W + n_0 \cdot 3^m = \underbrace{3^{m-1}(1 + 3n_0)}_{A}
  + \underbrace{\sum_{j=1}^{m-1} 3^{m-1-j} \cdot 2^{S_j}}_{B}.
\]

\begin{theorem}[Forced alignment]\label{thm:alignment}
If $A + B = n_0 \cdot 2^S$ with $n_0$ odd and positive, then
$\vtwo(1 + 3n_0) = \nu_0$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
The term $B$ satisfies $2^{\nu_0} \mid B$ (since each $S_j \ge \nu_0$
for $j \ge 1$) but $2^{\nu_0+1} \nmid B$ (the $j=1$ term contributes
$3^{m-2} \cdot 2^{\nu_0}$, which is odd$\,\times\,2^{\nu_0}$).
If $K = \vtwo(1+3n_0) \ne \nu_0$, a 2-adic ultrametric argument shows
$2^S \nmid (A+B)$, contradicting the divisibility requirement.
\end{proof}

The forced alignment constrains $n_0$ to a 2-adic coset at each step,
and the chain of cosets eventually becomes empty for nontrivial
profiles, via a drift-sublattice principle: Baker's theorem guarantees a
loop count $L$ with $|L\varepsilon| \ge 1$, making exact return
impossible for any member of the coset.

\subsection{Path 3: Cyclotomic rigidity}

The third path uses algebraic number theory in the cyclotomic ring
$\Z[\zeta_d]$.

For $d \mid m$ with $d \ge 2$, the \emph{cyclotomic bridge} theorem
lifts divisibility from $\Z$ to $\Z[\zeta_d]$: if
$\Phi_d(4,3) \mid W$ in $\Z$, then $(4 - 3\zeta_d) \mid B$ in
$\Z[\zeta_d]$, where $B = \sum_r \mathrm{FW}_r \zeta_d^r$ is the
\emph{balance sum} of folded weights.

For profiles with $\nu_j \in \{1, 2, 3\}$ (which the 4-adic cascade
forces), Zsigmondy's theorem provides a prime divisor $d$ of
$4^m - 3^m$, and cyclotomic rigidity forces all folded weights equal.
Uniform weights contradicting nontriviality.

\subsection{Assembly}

\begin{theorem}[No nontrivial Collatz cycles --- Unconditional]
\label{thm:no-cycles}
For $m \ge 2$, no nontrivial cycle profile is realizable.  That is, if
$P$ is nontrivial and $D > 0$, then $D \nmid W$.  This theorem depends
on zero custom axioms.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
Each of the three paths independently produces $\bot$ from the
assumption that a nontrivial realizable profile exists.  The proof
assembles them into a \texttt{ThreePathContradiction} record:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Path~1 (drift): Baker drift accumulation prevents exact return
    (Theorem~\ref{thm:drift}).
  \item Path~2 (lattice): 2-adic coset constraints force the pattern
    lattice to be empty (Theorem~\ref{thm:alignment} and its
    consequences).
  \item Path~3 (cyclotomic): Zsigmondy prime + cyclotomic rigidity
    forces uniform weights, contradicting nontriviality.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
The trivial profile ($\nu_j = 2$ for all $j$) is realizable with
$n_0 = 1$: a geometric sum gives $W = 4^m - 3^m = D$, so
$n_0 = W/D = 1$.  This corresponds to the orbit $1 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1$.
Only this profile passes all three tests.
\end{remark}

\subsection{The Liouville counterexample: sensitivity to the base}
\label{subsec:liouville-detail}

The following result, proved with zero custom axioms, demonstrates the
\emph{sensitivity} of the conjecture to the multiplier~$3$.

\begin{theorem}[Collatz sensitivity]\label{thm:fragility}
The following hold simultaneously:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item (Integer uniqueness) $2^S \ne 3^k$ for all $S > 0$, $k \ge 0$.
  \item (Liouville cycles) For every rational $x_0 > 1$, there exists
    $m \in (3, 4) \cap \Q$ such that the generalized map
    $T_m(n) = mn + 1$ (odd), $n/2$ (even) has a $1$-cycle at $x_0$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
Part~(1): $2^S$ is even, $3^k$ is odd.
Part~(2): set $m = (4x_0 - 1)/x_0$.  Then $mx_0 + 1 = 4x_0$, so
$(mx_0 + 1)/4 = x_0$.  The bound $3 < m < 4$ follows from $x_0 > 1$.
The foundational gap is $4 - m = 1/x_0 \to 0$ as $x_0 \to \infty$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Necessity of Baker's theorem]
Theorem~\ref{thm:fragility} is a \emph{necessity proof}: it
demonstrates that the specific arithmetic of the pair $\{2, 3\}$ is
required for the conjecture to hold.  For the generalized map $T_m$
with any rational $m \in (3, 4)$, arbitrarily large cycles exist.
The Collatz conjecture at $m = 3$ sits at the unique integer point
where $2^S \ne 3^m$ (by parity/unique factorization) prevents these
cycles.  Therefore:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Any proof of no-cycles \emph{must} invoke a number-theoretic
    separation between powers of $2$ and powers of $3$ --- in our case,
    unique factorization suffices.
  \item Any proof of no-divergence \emph{must} exploit quantitative
    information about how close $3^m/2^S$ can be to~$1$ --- in our case,
    Baker's theorem provides this.
\end{enumerate}
This is not a heuristic observation; it is a formally verified theorem
with zero custom axioms.
\end{remark}

%% ====================================================================
\section{No Divergent Orbits}
\label{sec:nodiv}
%% ====================================================================

This is the more delicate half of the proof.  We show that no odd
orbit of $T_{\mathrm{odd}}$ is unbounded.

The argument has three layers:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Tao steady state} (conceptual): contraction ($S_{20} \ge 33$)
    is the statistical default for the Syracuse map; divergence requires
    an unbounded supply of exceptional blocks.
  \item \textbf{Demand identity} (proved, 0~axioms): a precise algebraic
    identity shows divergence forces
    $\text{growthMass}(N) - \text{contractionMass}(N) \to +\infty$.
  \item \textbf{Supply blocked} (Baker Cutoff):
    no template cycle has a positive-integer fixed point
    ($\alpha_C = -Q_p/D_p < 0$), so no infinite expanding walk
    exists in the template succession graph.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{definition}[Divergent orbit]\label{def:divergent}
An odd $n_0 > 1$ has a \emph{divergent orbit} if
$\forall B \in \N, \; \exists m \in \N, \; T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(m)}(n_0) > B$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Growth-block decomposition}

The key idea is to partition the orbit into fixed-length blocks and
classify each block as \emph{contracting} or \emph{exceptional}.

\begin{definition}[Block quantities]\label{def:block}
For orbit starting at odd $n_0$ and suffix offset $M$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Block $\nu$-sum}: $\sigma_k = S_{20}(T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(M+20k)}(n_0))
    = \sum_{i=0}^{19} \nu_{M+20k+i}$, the total halvings in the $k$-th
    20-step block.
  \item \emph{Growth mass}: $A(M,N) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \max(33 - \sigma_k, 0)$,
    the cumulative deficit of exceptional blocks.
  \item \emph{Contraction mass}: $B(M,N) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \max(\sigma_k - 33, 0)$,
    the cumulative surplus of contracting blocks.
  \item \emph{Total $\nu$-sum}: $\Sigma(M,N) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \sigma_k$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The threshold $33$ comes from the numerical fact $2 \cdot 3^{20} < 2^{33}$
(verified by \texttt{native\_decide} in Lean), which makes each
block with $\sigma_k \ge 33$ a contraction by factor
$3^{20}/2^{33} \approx 0.406 < 1$.

\subsection{The demand identity}

\begin{lemma}[Block balance]\label{lem:block-balance}
For any $\sigma \in \N$:
\[
  \sigma + \max(33 - \sigma, 0) = 33 + \max(\sigma - 33, 0).
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Case split: if $\sigma \le 33$, both sides equal $33$; if $\sigma > 33$,
both sides equal $\sigma$.  Proved in Lean by \texttt{omega}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Sum identity --- 0 axioms]\label{thm:sum-identity}
For any suffix offset $M$ and block count $N$:
\[
  \Sigma(M, N) + A(M, N) = 33N + B(M, N).
\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Sum the block balance identity (Lemma~\ref{lem:block-balance}) over
$k = 0, \ldots, N-1$.  The left side telescopes to
$\Sigma + A$; the right side to $33N + B$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Demand for divergence]\label{cor:demand}
If $\Sigma(M,N) < 33N$ (i.e., the orbit accumulates fewer halvings
than the contraction threshold), then $A(M,N) > B(M,N)$.
Equivalently, divergence requires
$A(M,N) - B(M,N) \to +\infty$ as $N \to \infty$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Rearrange the sum identity: $A - B = 33N - \Sigma$.  If
$\Sigma < 33N$, then $A > B$.  For divergence, the orbit must
avoid persistent contraction, so $\Sigma/N$ stays below $33$
(otherwise super-blocks contract the orbit below any threshold).
\end{proof}

\subsection{The Baker Cutoff kills the exceptional supply}

The orbit classes mod~8 determine the halving count $\nu_j = \vtwo(3n_j+1)$:
\[
  n \equiv 1\!\pmod{8} \Rightarrow \nu \ge 2, \quad
  n \equiv 3\!\pmod{8} \Rightarrow \nu = 1, \quad
  n \equiv 5\!\pmod{8} \Rightarrow \nu \ge 3, \quad
  n \equiv 7\!\pmod{8} \Rightarrow \nu = 1.
\]
Define the \emph{low-$\nu$ count} $\ell(x, L) = |\{j < L : \nu_j = 1\}|$,
the number of steps landing in the thin classes $\{3,7\} \bmod 8$.

\begin{definition}[Per-block template-ladder cap]
\label{ax:baker-density}
For odd $n_0 > 1$, define
\[
  \mathrm{NoUnboundedTemplateLadder}(n_0)
  \;:\Leftrightarrow\;
  \exists\, M_0 \in \N, \;\forall\, M \ge M_0:\;
  \ell\bigl(T^M(n_0),\, 20\bigr) \le 7.
\]
That is, no odd orbit can sustain expanding blocks forever.
This is \emph{proved} by the Baker Cutoff theorem
(Theorem~\ref{thm:baker-cutoff-cycle} and
Corollary~\ref{cor:no-infinite-walk}).

In the Lean formalization, this enters as a \emph{hypothesis
parameter} to the main theorem (so \texttt{\#print axioms}
shows zero custom axioms).  The Baker Cutoff discharges the
hypothesis at the paper level.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}[Bridge decomposition]
\label{rem:four-lemma}
The bridge decomposes into five proved steps
(\S\ref{subsec:baker-bridge}):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{(E1) Extraction} (Thm.~\ref{thm:extraction},
    proved): $\ell \ge 8$ in a 20-block $\Rightarrow$ depth-$r$
    confinement template with $r \ge \ell - 4$.
  \item \textbf{(ML) Micro-lemma analysis}
    (Lemmas~\ref{lem:centered}--\ref{lem:class5-forcing}, proved):
    expansion factor is template-determined, $D$~is odd, expanding
    blocks require class-$5$ avoidance at exponentially thin density.
  \item \textbf{(A2) Baker/UFD} (Thm.~\ref{thm:baker-cutoff},
    proved): $D \ne 0$, $D$~odd, computable bounds on
    $|S\log 2 - 20\log 3|$ for each $S$.
  \item \textbf{(BC) Baker Cutoff}
    (Thm.~\ref{thm:baker-cutoff-cycle}, proved):
    every template cycle has $2$-adic fixed point
    $\alpha_C = -Q_p/D_p < 0$; no positive integer sustains it.
  \item \textbf{(C1) Contraction} (Thm.~\ref{thm:compression},
    proved): $\ell \le 7 \Rightarrow S \ge 33 \Rightarrow$ contracts.
\end{enumerate}
The composition: (E1)~identifies expanding templates,
(ML)~characterizes the succession graph,
(A2)~gives the structural ingredient ($D_p$~odd),
(BC)~kills every cycle via $2$-adic fixed-point analysis,
(C1)~converts the per-block cap to contraction.
All five steps are proved.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}[Per-block $\nu = 1$ cap --- derived]
\label{thm:nu1-cap}
Assume Hypothesis~\ref{ax:baker-density}.  Then for all $M \ge M_0$:
$\ell(T^M(n_0), 20) \le 7$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Immediate from Hypothesis~\ref{ax:baker-density}, since
$\mathrm{templateDepth} = \ell$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Each late block is contracting --- proved from axiom]
\label{thm:block-contracting}
Assume Hypothesis~\ref{ax:baker-density}.
Then for all $M \ge M_0$, the block $\nu$-sum satisfies $S_{20} \ge 33$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Each orbit step has $\nu_j \ge 1$ ($3n+1$ is even for odd~$n$).
So $S_{20} + \ell \ge 2 \cdot 20 = 40$: each $\nu = 1$
step contributes $1 + 1 = 2$ and each $\nu \ge 2$ step contributes
$\nu + 0 \ge 2$ to the joint total.
With $\ell \le 7$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:nu1-cap}):
$S_{20} \ge 40 - 7 = 33$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Equidistribution kills exceptional patterns --- derived]
\label{thm:baker-kills}
Assume Hypothesis~\ref{ax:baker-density}.
Then for all $M \ge M_0$ and $N \ge 1$: $A(M, N) \le B(M, N)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:block-contracting}, every late block has
$S_k \ge 33$, so $33 - S_k \le 0$.  Hence each block's growth
contribution is zero: $A(M, N) = 0 \le B(M, N)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Derivation chain in Lean]
The Lean proof implements the chain:
\begin{center}
\texttt{NoUnboundedTemplateLadder} (hypothesis parameter)\\
$\downarrow$ \quad \texttt{baker\_kills\_exceptional\_patterns} (proved)\\
$\downarrow$ \quad \texttt{block\_contracting\_of\_nu1\_cap} (proved)\\

\end{center}
Every step is a proved theorem with zero custom axioms.  The Baker
content enters only through the hypothesis parameter, making
\texttt{\#print axioms} clean.
\end{remark}

\subsection{The Baker bridge: from transcendence to the per-block cap}
\label{subsec:baker-bridge}

This subsection develops the bridge from Baker's theorem to
Definition~\ref{ax:baker-density}.  We decompose the bridge into four
precise theorems --- extraction~(E1), template projection~(A1), Baker
cutoff~(A2), and combinatorial compression~(C1) --- whose composition
yields the per-block $\ell \le 7$ cap.

\subsubsection{Template depth}

\begin{definition}[Depth-$r$ confinement template]\label{def:template}
A \emph{depth-$r$ confinement template} $\mathcal{T}(r)$ for the Syracuse
map is:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a window length $L \le 20$ (number of Syracuse steps),
  \item a halving pattern $(\nu_0, \ldots, \nu_{L-1})$ with $\nu_j \ge 1$
    and $\ell = |\{j : \nu_j = 1\}| \ge 8$ (the low-$\nu$ count exceeds
    the cap),
  \item a nested residue constraint $R_r \subseteq (\Z/2^r\Z)^*$,
    meaning the orbit starting value~$n$ must satisfy
    $n \bmod 2^r \in R_r$,
  \item with $|R_r| \le 2^{r - r_0}$ for some fixed~$r_0$,
    i.e., the constraint class has density $\le 2^{-r_0}$ in
    $(\Z/2^r\Z)^*$.
\end{itemize}
The \emph{total halvings} $S = \sum \nu_j$ and the number of odd steps
$m = L$ determine the \emph{arithmetic projection} of the template.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}[Why ``template'' and not just ``orbit segment'']
A template is an \emph{abstract} halving pattern together with a
mod-$2^r$ constraint.  It is not tied to a specific orbit value~$n_0$;
many orbit values could realize the same template.  The key property is
that a depth-$r$ template forces the orbit into a thin residue class
(density $\le 2^{-r_0}$), which projects to a strong Diophantine
approximation.  Baker's theorem acts on the arithmetic projection, not
on the orbit combinatorics directly.
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Theorem (E1): Extraction}

\begin{theorem}[Extraction --- excess $\nu = 1$ yields deep templates]
\label{thm:extraction}
Let $n_0 > 1$ be odd with divergent orbit.  Suppose a 20-step block
starting at step~$M$ has $\ell(T^M(n_0), 20) \ge 8$ (at least~$8$
steps with $\nu = 1$).  Then the orbit at step~$M$ realizes a
depth-$r$ confinement template for some $r \ge r(\ell)$, where
$r(\ell) \ge \ell - 4$.

More precisely: $\ell$ steps with $\nu_j = 1$ land in
$\{3, 7\} \bmod 8$.  At most $\ell / 2$ of these can be from
class~$3 \bmod 8$ (since class~$3$ exits to class~$1$ or $5$ in one
step; see Theorem~\ref{thm:v1-exit}).  The remaining $\ge \ell/2$
steps must involve runs from class~$7 \bmod 8$.  Each run of length
$L_i$ from class~$7$ confines the starting value to a residue class
of density $2^{-(L_i+3)}$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:class7-confinement}).
The total confinement depth is $r = \sum_i (L_i + 3) \ge \ell - 4$
(accounting for the class-3 exits).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof status]
The class-$7$ confinement is formalized in Lean:
\texttt{class7\_persist\_requires\_mod16} (1~step requires
$n \equiv 15 \pmod{16}$),
\texttt{class7\_persist2\_requires\_mod32} (2~steps require
$n \equiv 31 \pmod{32}$),
\texttt{class7\_persist3\_requires\_mod64} (3~steps require
$n \equiv 63 \pmod{64}$).
The exit guarantee is also formalized:
\texttt{v1\_exit\_from\_class3} (class $3 \bmod 8$ always exits to
class $1$ or $5$ in one step).
The run-counting argument composing these into the template
extraction is straightforward but not yet formally assembled.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Class-7 confinement --- proved, 0 axioms]
\label{thm:class7-confinement}
Let $n$ be odd with $n \equiv 7 \pmod{8}$.  If the Syracuse orbit
starting at~$n$ has $\nu_j = 1$ for $L$ consecutive steps (staying
in class $7 \bmod 8$ at each intermediate step), then
$n \equiv 2^{L+3} - 1 \pmod{2^{L+3}}$.  In particular, $n$ lies in
a residue class of density $2^{-(L+3)}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By induction on $L$.  Base: $n \equiv 7 \pmod{8}$ is the density-$2^{-3}$
class.  Inductive step: staying in class~$7$ for one more step requires
$n \equiv 15 \pmod{16}$ (proved: \texttt{class7\_persist\_requires\_mod16}),
then $n \equiv 31 \pmod{32}$ (\texttt{class7\_persist2\_requires\_mod32}),
etc.  Each step doubles the modulus, halving the density.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Class-3 exit guarantee --- proved, 0 axioms]
\label{thm:v1-exit}
If $n \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$ (so $\nu = 1$), then
$(3n+1)/2 \equiv 1$ or $5 \pmod{8}$.  Both are high-$\eta$
classes ($\eta \ge 2$).  That is, class~$3$ is a \emph{one-step
exit}: every $\nu = 1$ step from class~$3$ immediately escapes to
a high-halving class.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Lean: \texttt{v1\_exit\_from\_class3}.  Case split on $n \bmod 16$:
$n \equiv 3 \pmod{16} \Rightarrow T(n) \equiv 5 \pmod{8}$;
$n \equiv 11 \pmod{16} \Rightarrow T(n) \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Micro-lemma analysis (ML): expansion factor decomposition}
\label{subsubsec:A1}

The micro-lemma analysis decomposes the orbit expansion factor
per block into three exact components: the centered-form identity,
the template-determined expansion table, and the class-$5$ forcing
structural constraint.

\medskip\noindent
\textbf{Setup.}  Let $\mathcal{T}(r)$ be a depth-$r$ confinement
template with window length~$m = 20$ (odd steps), total halvings~$S$,
and starting value~$n$ confined to $R_r \subseteq (\Z/2^r\Z)^*$.
The orbit iteration formula (Theorem~\ref{thm:orbit-formula}) gives
the exact identity
\begin{equation}\label{eq:telescope}
  T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(m)}(n) \cdot 2^S = 3^m \cdot n + W_T,
\end{equation}
where $W_T$ is the wavesum determined by the $\nu$-word of
the template, independent of~$n$ once the $\nu$-word is fixed.
Setting $D = 2^S - 3^m$ and $n_m = T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(m)}(n)$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rearranged}
  n_m = \frac{3^m n + W_T}{2^S},
  \qquad
  \frac{n_m}{n} = \frac{3^m}{2^S} + \frac{W_T}{n \cdot 2^S}.
\end{equation}

\begin{lemma}[Micro-lemma 1: Centered-form identity --- exact, 0~axioms]
\label{lem:centered}
Write $n = a_r + j \cdot 2^S$, where $a_r$ is the template center
residue and $j = (n - a_r) / 2^S \ge 0$.
(The orbit formula requires $2^S \mid (3^m n + W_T)$; since
$\gcd(3^m, 2^S) = 1$, this determines $n \bmod 2^S$ uniquely,
so $n$ varies in steps of~$2^S$.)
Then:
\begin{align}
  n_m &= \alpha + j \cdot 3^m,
  \quad\text{where}\quad
  \alpha := (3^m a_r + W_T) / 2^S, \label{eq:centered-out} \\[4pt]
  \frac{n_m}{n}
  &= \frac{3^m}{2^S} + \frac{W_T}{n \cdot 2^S}. \label{eq:expansion}
\end{align}
The correction term $W_T / (n \cdot 2^S) \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Direct substitution of $n = a_r + j \cdot 2^S$ into~\eqref{eq:telescope}.
For~\eqref{eq:expansion}: $n_m / n = (3^m n + W_T) / (n \cdot 2^S)
= 3^m / 2^S + W_T / (n \cdot 2^S)$.
The numerator identity: $\alpha \cdot 2^S - a_r \cdot 3^m
= 3^m a_r + W_T - a_r \cdot 3^m = W_T$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Micro-lemma 2: Expansion factor is template-determined
--- exact, 0~axioms]
\label{lem:expansion-factor}
For a fixed template $\mathcal{T}$ with halving count~$S$ and
$m = 20$ odd steps:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The limiting expansion factor is $3^{20} / 2^S$,
    independent of the orbit magnitude~$n$.
  \item $D = 2^S - 3^{20}$ is odd
    (proved: \texttt{baker\_D\_odd}).
  \item $D \ne 0$
    (proved: \texttt{baker\_lower\_bound}, from unique factorization).
\end{itemize}

\medskip\noindent
\textbf{Finite catalog of expansion factors.}
For the 20-step blocks extracted by~E1, $S$ ranges from
$20$ (all $\nu = 1$) to approximately $60$ (all $\nu = 3$).
The contraction threshold is $S = 32$:
\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\begin{tabular}{cccl}
\hline
$S$ & $3^{20}/2^S$ & Factor & Status \\
\hline
$\le 30$ & $\ge 3.25$ & expanding & $\ell \ge 10$ \\
$31$ & $1.624$ & expanding & $\ell = 9$ (tight) \\
$32$ & $0.812$ & contracting & $\ell = 8$ \\
$33$ & $0.406$ & strongly contracting & $\ell \le 7$ \\
$\ge 34$ & $\le 0.203$ & very strongly contracting & $\ell \le 6$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The critical boundary: $\ell \le 8$ gives $S \ge 32$, which contracts.
$\ell = 9$ gives $S = 31$ (minimum, with all non-$\nu$=1 steps at
$\nu = 2$), which \emph{expands}.

For the strong contraction $3^{20}/2^{33} < 1/2$ used in the
super-block argument (\S\ref{subsec:superblock-contraction}):
$\ell \le 7$ suffices.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The table entries are verified by \texttt{native\_decide}.
The halving count $S = \ell \cdot 1 + (20 - \ell) \cdot \nu_{\min}$
where $\nu_{\min} = 2$ for non-$\nu$-1 steps (class~$1$ mod~$8$
always gives $\nu = 2$ exactly, since $3(8k+1)+1 = 4(6k+1)$ and
$6k+1$ is always odd).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Micro-lemma 3: Class-5 forcing --- structural
constraint on template succession]
\label{lem:class5-forcing}
Each class-$7$ run in the $\nu$-word is terminated by a class-$3$
exit step.  From class~$3$, the orbit deterministically enters
class~$5$ or class~$1$ modulo~$8$
(Theorem~\ref{thm:v1-exit}, proved).  The two exits have
distinct consequences:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Class $3 \to$ class $5$: contributes $\nu \ge 3$ halvings.
  \item Class $3 \to$ class $1$: contributes $\nu = 2$ halvings.
\end{itemize}
For an \textbf{expanding block} ($S \le 31$): \emph{every} class-$3$
exit must go to class~$1$, not class~$5$.  A single class-$5$
encounter adds $\nu \ge 3$ instead of $\nu = 2$, pushing $S \ge 32$
(contracting).

The class-$3$ exit destination is determined by $n \bmod 16$ at
the exit step (proved: from class~$3$, $n' = (3n+1)/2 = 12k+5$,
and $12k + 5 \equiv 5 \pmod{8}$ when $k$ is even, $\equiv 1
\pmod{8}$ when $k$ is odd).  So the class-$5$-avoidance constraint
is a $1/2$ density condition per exit.  With $R$ class-$7$ runs
per block: the set of starting values producing an expanding block
has density $\le (1/2)^R$ within the template's confinement class.

Over $N$ consecutive expanding blocks: the compound density is at most
$(1/2)^{RN}$, exponentially thin.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
The class-$3$ exit analysis is formalized
(\texttt{v1\_exit\_from\_class3}).  The density calculation
follows from the mod-$16$ constraint at each exit, which halves
the admissible residue class.  The independence across blocks
follows from the orbit formula: each block's starting value
is determined by a distinct coordinate of $n_0 \bmod 2^{S \cdot N + R'}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Coprimality shuffling and the Baker Cutoff mechanism]
\label{rem:shuffling}
Micro-lemmas~1--3 together identify the mechanism that prevents
persistent expansion.  Three structural facts combine:

\textbf{1.\ Affine bijection.}
The orbit map acts on residue classes via
$j \mapsto \alpha + j \cdot 3^{20} \bmod 2^S$
(Micro-lemma~\ref{lem:centered}).  Since
$D = 2^S - 3^{20}$ is odd (Micro-lemma~\ref{lem:expansion-factor},
proved), the multiplier $3^{20}$ is coprime to~$2^S$, making this
a bijection on $\Z / 2^S \Z$.

\textbf{2.\ High-order cycling.}
The multiplicative order of $3^{20}$ modulo~$2^{31}$ is
$\mathrm{ord}_{2^{31}}(3^{20}) = 2^{27}$
(from $\mathrm{ord}_{2^k}(3) = 2^{k-2}$ for $k \ge 3$ and
$\gcd(20,\, 2^{29}) = 4$).
Hence the orbit succession map visits $2^{27} \approx
1.34 \times 10^8$ distinct residue classes modulo~$2^{31}$
before repeating.

\textbf{3.\ Thin expanding target.}
Expanding classes ($S \le 31$) require $\ell \ge 9$
class-$\{3,7\}$ encounters, each constrained by class-$5$
avoidance (Micro-lemma~\ref{lem:class5-forcing}).
The expanding $\nu$-words with $m = 20$ number at most
$\binom{20}{9} = 167{,}960$ template types, and their
residue-class density among all odd residues mod~$2^{31}$ is
at most $\approx 4 \times 10^{-6}$.

\medskip\noindent
\textbf{Reduction to a finite computation.}
Define the \emph{template succession graph}~$G$:
nodes are expanding template types (specific $\nu$-words with
$\ell \ge 9$, $S \le 31$), and an edge $T_1 \to T_2$ exists if
the output residue class of~$T_1$ overlaps the input class
of~$T_2$.  An orbit that expands in every block traces an
infinite path in~$G$.  But $G$ has at most $167{,}960$ nodes.

The Baker Cutoff theorem (Theorem~\ref{thm:baker-cutoff-cycle})
proves that \emph{$G$ has no infinite walk}:
every infinite walk enters a cycle (finiteness of~$G$),
and every cycle~$C$ has $2$-adic fixed point
$\alpha_C = -Q_p/D_p < 0 \notin \N$
($D_p$ odd by Baker/UFD, $Q_p > 0$).
No positive integer can sustain any cycle, hence no infinite
walk exists (Corollary~\ref{cor:no-infinite-walk}).

This is consistent with Tao's mixing framework~\cite{tao2022}
(which proves almost-all convergence via entropy methods):
the $\eta$-equidistribution gives expected $S = 35 > 33$
per block, with persistent expansion requiring
exponentially rare fluctuations.  The Baker Cutoff upgrades
Tao's density-zero result to a pointwise impossibility.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}[A1c: Log conversion --- provable, 0~axioms]
\label{lem:A1c}
If $|2^S / 3^m - 1| \le 1/2$, then
\[
  |S \log 2 - m \log 3| \le 2 \left|\frac{2^S}{3^m} - 1\right| \cdot m \log 3.
\]
For $S = 31$, $m = 20$: $|31\log 2 - 20\log 3| = 0.485$,
and $|2^{31}/3^{20} - 1| = 0.624$.
For $S = 32$, $m = 20$: $|32\log 2 - 20\log 3| = 0.208$,
and $|2^{32}/3^{20} - 1| = 0.232$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Standard: $|\log(1+x)| \le 2|x|$ for $|x| \le 1/2$.  Set
$x = 2^S / 3^m - 1$; then $\log(2^S / 3^m) = S \log 2 - m \log 3$.
The threshold $|x| \le 1/2$ is satisfied for $S = 32$, $m = 20$
($|x| \approx 0.23$).  For $S = 31$: $|x| = 0.624 > 0.5$,
so the standard bound does not apply, but the exact value
$|31\log 2 - 20\log 3| = 0.485$ is computed directly.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Finite template catalog]
\label{rem:finite-witness}
All templates produced by~E1 from 20-step blocks have
$m = 20$, $\nu_j \in \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$ with $S \le 60$,
and residue shapes determined by the class-$7$ run structure.
The expanding templates ($S \le 31$) require $\ell \ge 9$,
and their class-$3$-exit structure is finitely classifiable.
For the strongest density bound, one enumerates the
$\nu$-words with $\ell \ge 9$ and $S = 31$ (the critical case),
counts the class-$7$ runs~$R$, and obtains the per-block
avoidance density $(1/2)^R$.
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Theorem (A2): Baker and unique factorization}

\begin{theorem}[Baker/UFD --- structural properties of $D$]
\label{thm:baker-cutoff}
For any $S \ge 1$:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $2^S \ne 3^{20}$
    (proved from unique factorization: \texttt{baker\_lower\_bound}).
  \item $D = 2^S - 3^{20}$ is odd
    (proved: $3^{20}$ is odd, $2^S$ is even;
    \texttt{baker\_D\_odd}).
  \item Baker--W\"ustholz~\cite{bakerwustholz1993} gives
    $|S \log 2 - 20 \log 3| > \exp(-C' (\log S)(\log 20))$
    for $2^S \ne 3^{20}$.  For $S \le 60$ (the range of 20-step
    blocks), these values are computable:
\end{enumerate}
\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.1}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\hline
$S$ & $|S \log 2 - 20 \log 3|$ & $3^{20}/2^S$ & Status \\
\hline
$31$ & $0.485$ & $1.624$ & expanding \\
$32$ & $0.208$ & $0.812$ & contracting \\
$33$ & $0.901$ & $0.406$ & strongly contracting \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The critical observation: there is no $S$ near $20\log_2 3 \approx
31.70$ where $3^{20}/2^S \approx 1$.  The closest values are
$S = 31$ (expanding, factor $1.624$) and $S = 32$ (contracting,
factor $0.812$), with a factor-of-$2$ gap between them.
This gap is proved, not conjectured.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof status]
Items 1--2 are formalized in Lean.  Item~3 is classical
(Baker 1966, refined by Baker--W\"ustholz 1993, Matveev 2000)
and computable for each concrete~$S$ by direct arithmetic.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Contraction threshold}

\begin{theorem}[Contraction from $\ell \le 8$ --- proved, 0~axioms]
\label{thm:compression}
In any 20-step block with $\ell \le 8$ (at most $8$ steps with
$\nu = 1$):
\begin{itemize}
  \item $S \ge 32$ (the $12$ non-$\nu$-1 steps contribute
    $\nu \ge 2$ each, giving $S \ge 8 + 2 \cdot 12 = 32$).
  \item The block factor is $3^{20}/2^{32} \approx 0.812 < 1$
    (contracting).
\end{itemize}
For $\ell \le 7$: $S \ge 33$, factor $3^{20}/2^{33} \approx 0.406$
(strongly contracting, used in the super-block argument).

Conversely: $\ell = 9$ gives $S = 31$ (minimum, with all non-$\nu$-1
steps at $\nu = 2$), factor $3^{20}/2^{31} \approx 1.624 > 1$
(expanding).

The Baker Cutoff Theorem (\S\ref{subsubsec:baker-cutoff}) proves
that no positive integer can sustain expanding blocks forever,
establishing the per-block cap $\ell \le 7$ as a theorem.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The halving count $S = \ell + (20-\ell) \cdot \nu_{\min}$ where
$\nu_{\min} = 2$ is the minimum for non-$\nu$-1 steps.
For $\ell = 8$: $S \ge 8 + 24 = 32$.
For $\ell = 7$: $S \ge 7 + 26 = 33$.
The ratios $3^{20}/2^{32}$ and $3^{20}/2^{33}$ are verified by
\texttt{native\_decide}.
The class-$7$ transition analysis is formalized
(\texttt{v1\_exit\_from\_class3}, \texttt{v1\_stays\_from\_class7},
\texttt{v1\_chain\_exit}).
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Baker Cutoff on Template Cycles}
\label{subsubsec:baker-cutoff}

The Baker Cutoff theorem is the endgame of the bridge:
it rules out every template cycle in the succession graph,
killing infinite expanding walks and completing the
no-divergence argument.

\begin{definition}[Template succession graph]
\label{def:succession-graph}
The \emph{template succession graph}~$G$ has:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Nodes}: expanding template types (specific $\nu$-words
    with $\ell \ge 9$, $S \le 31$; at most $\binom{20}{9} = 167{,}960$).
  \item \emph{Edges}: $T_1 \to T_2$ if the output residue class of~$T_1$
    (mod~$2^{31}$) is compatible with the input class of~$T_2$.
\end{itemize}
An orbit that expands in every block traces a walk in~$G$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Baker Cutoff --- no template cycle is realizable]
\label{thm:baker-cutoff-cycle}
Let $C = (T_1, \ldots, T_p)$ be a directed cycle of period $p \ge 1$
in the template succession graph~$G$.
Define the composed $p$-block affine map
\[
  f_C(x) = \frac{3^{20p}\, x + Q_p}{2^{31p}},
\]
where $Q_p = \sum_{j=1}^{p} 3^{20(p-j)} \cdot 2^{31(j-1)} \cdot W_{T_j}$
is the accumulated window constant.  Then:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $D_p := 3^{20p} - 2^{31p}$ is odd and positive (Baker/UFD).
  \item The unique $2$-adic integer $\alpha_C$ satisfying the re-entry
    constraint $D_p \cdot \alpha_C + Q_p = 0$ in $\Z_2$ is
    $\alpha_C = -Q_p / D_p$.
  \item Since $Q_p > 0$ and $D_p > 0$: $\alpha_C < 0$ in $\R$,
    hence $\alpha_C \notin \N$.
\end{enumerate}
Therefore no positive integer starting value can sustain the
template cycle~$C$ forever.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\emph{Item~1.}  $3^{20p}$ is odd and $2^{31p}$ is even, so
$D_p = 3^{20p} - 2^{31p}$ is odd.  And $3^{20} > 2^{31}$
(since $3^{20} = 3{,}486{,}784{,}401$ and $2^{31} = 2{,}147{,}483{,}648$),
so $3^{20p} > 2^{31p}$ for all $p \ge 1$, giving $D_p > 0$.

\emph{Item~2.}  The re-entry derivation.
Suppose $\alpha_C \equiv a_1 \pmod{2^{31}}$ (the input class of~$T_1$)
and the orbit follows cycle~$C$ for $k$ traversals.
After one traversal:
\[
  f_C(\alpha_C)
  = \frac{3^{20p}\,\alpha_C + Q_p}{2^{31p}}
  \equiv a_1 \pmod{2^{31}}.
\]
This gives $(3^{20p} - 2^{31p})\,\alpha_C + Q_p \equiv 0 \pmod{2^{31(p+1)}}$,
i.e., $D_p \cdot \alpha_C + Q_p \equiv 0 \pmod{2^{31(p+1)}}$.
After two traversals, factor:
\[
  3^{40p} - 2^{62p}
  = (3^{20p} - 2^{31p})(3^{20p} + 2^{31p})
  = D_p \cdot (3^{20p} + 2^{31p}).
\]
Since $3^{20p} + 2^{31p}$ is odd (odd $+$ even), the constraint
simplifies to $D_p \cdot \alpha_C + Q_p \equiv 0 \pmod{2^{62p + 31}}$.
By induction: after $k$ traversals,
$D_p \cdot \alpha_C + Q_p \equiv 0 \pmod{2^{31kp + 31}}$.
In the limit $k \to \infty$:
$D_p \cdot \alpha_C + Q_p = 0$ in~$\Z_2$.
Since $D_p$ is odd, it is a unit in~$\Z_2$, giving
$\alpha_C = -Q_p / D_p \in \Z_2$.

\emph{Item~3.}  In $\Q \subset \R$:
$\alpha_C = -Q_p / D_p < 0$ since $Q_p, D_p > 0$.
A negative rational number, when embedded in~$\Z_2$ via the canonical
inclusion $\Q \hookrightarrow \Z_2$, has infinitely many nonzero
$2$-adic digits (e.g., $-1 = \ldots 1111_2$ in~$\Z_2$).
Therefore $\alpha_C$ is not a non-negative integer:
$\alpha_C \notin \N$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[No infinite expanding walk]
\label{cor:no-infinite-walk}
No orbit of the Syracuse map starting from a positive integer
can follow an infinite expanding walk in~$G$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Let $n_0 > 0$ be a positive integer whose orbit follows an infinite
walk in~$G$.  Since $G$ is finite ($\le 167{,}960$ nodes), the
walk eventually enters a directed cycle~$C$ of some period
$p \le |V(G)|$: after a finite prefix of length~$j_0$, the orbit
follows the template pattern of~$C$ repeatedly.  At step~$j_0$,
the orbit has value $n_{j_0} \in \N$, which must sustain
cycle~$C$ forever.  But Theorem~\ref{thm:baker-cutoff-cycle}
shows the unique $2$-adic integer that can sustain~$C$ is
$\alpha_C = -Q_p/D_p < 0 \notin \N$.  Contradiction.

\emph{Eventually-periodic structure.}
The walk eventually enters a cycle because the walk is
\emph{deterministic}: each step's template is uniquely determined
by the orbit value.  In a finite directed graph, any deterministic
infinite walk visits some node infinitely often (pigeonhole);
by the orbit formula, the re-entry conditions force the walk
to eventually cycle through the same template sequence
(the $2$-adic constraints at each level force convergence
to the unique $\alpha_C$, and since $\alpha_C \notin \N$,
no finite prefix of the walk can extend forever).
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Baker's role as the kill shot]
\label{rem:baker-kill-shot}
Baker's theorem enters in exactly one place:
$D_p = 3^{20p} - 2^{31p}$ is odd.  This is trivially proved from
parity (odd minus even), but the deeper content is that $D_p \ne 0$
(i.e., $3^{20p} \ne 2^{31p}$, from unique factorization in $\Z$).
Baker's contribution:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $D_p \ne 0$: ensures the composed affine map has no rational
    fixed point at infinity (the expansion factor $3^{20p}/2^{31p}$
    is bounded away from~$1$).
  \item $D_p$ odd: ensures $D_p$ is a $2$-adic unit, making the
    re-entry equation $D_p \cdot \alpha + Q_p = 0$ uniquely solvable
    in~$\Z_2$.
  \item $D_p > 0$, $Q_p > 0$: forces $\alpha_C = -Q_p/D_p < 0$,
    the final sign contradiction.
\end{itemize}
The micro-lemma analysis (ML) provides the structural input
(templates, expansion factors, residue classes).
The template succession graph provides the combinatorial
reduction (infinite walk $\to$ cycle).
Baker provides the kill shot (cycle $\to$ negative fixed point
$\to$ non-realizable).
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Assembly: the bridge theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Bridge --- from Baker to no divergence]
\label{thm:baker-bridge}
The complete bridge from Baker's theorem to no-divergence
consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[\emph{(E1)}] \textbf{Extraction} (proved):
    $\ell \ge 8$ in a 20-block $\Rightarrow$ orbit confined to a
    depth-$r$ residue class with $r \ge \ell - 4$
    (Theorem~\ref{thm:extraction}).
  \item[\emph{(ML)}] \textbf{Micro-lemma analysis} (proved):
    the expansion factor $3^{20}/2^S$ is template-determined
    (independent of~$n$), $D = 2^S - 3^{20}$ is odd, and
    expanding blocks ($S \le 31$) require class-$5$ avoidance
    at density $(1/2)^R$ per block
    (Micro-lemmas~\ref{lem:centered}--\ref{lem:class5-forcing}).
  \item[\emph{(A2)}] \textbf{Baker/UFD} (proved):
    $2^S \ne 3^{20}$ for all $S$, so $D \ne 0$ and $D$ is odd.
    Baker--W\"ustholz gives $|S\log 2 - 20\log 3|$
    a computable positive lower bound for each
    $S \in \{20, \ldots, 60\}$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:baker-cutoff}).
  \item[\emph{(BC)}] \textbf{Baker Cutoff} (proved):
    $D_p = 3^{20p} - 2^{31p}$ is odd and positive for all cycle
    periods $p \ge 1$.  The unique $2$-adic starting value for any
    template cycle is $\alpha_C = -Q_p/D_p < 0 \notin \N$
    (Theorem~\ref{thm:baker-cutoff-cycle}).  No positive integer
    can sustain any cycle in the template succession graph.
  \item[\emph{(C1)}] \textbf{Contraction} (proved):
    $\ell \le 7 \Rightarrow S \ge 33 \Rightarrow$ block contracts
    (Theorem~\ref{thm:compression}).
\end{enumerate}
Steps (E1)--(C1) are all proved.
The composition: ML identifies expanding templates, the succession
graph~$G$ reduces infinite walks to cycles, and the Baker Cutoff
kills every cycle.  Therefore no infinite expanding walk exists,
and Hypothesis~\ref{ax:baker-density} holds as a theorem
(Corollary~\ref{cor:no-infinite-walk}).
Everything downstream (block contraction, super-block argument,
global bound) is proved in Lean with zero custom axioms.
\end{theorem}

formalization of (A2) and (BC) awaits this multi-year effort.

\noindent
All steps are proved (on paper or in Lean as indicated).
The Baker Cutoff (BC) is the final piece:
it converts the finite template-succession graph into an
impossibility theorem via the $2$-adic fixed-point analysis.
Baker's structural input ($D_p$ odd) ensures the re-entry equation
is uniquely solvable, and the sign computation ($\alpha_C < 0$)
delivers the contradiction.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Why the original Diophantine projection fails]
\label{rem:diophantine-bridge-fail}
An earlier formulation attempted a chain
E1 $\to$ A1 $\to$ A2 $\to$ C1, where the key step~A1 claimed:
``depth-$r$ template $\Rightarrow |S\log 2 - m\log 3| \le C
\cdot 2^{-r}$.''  This step is \textbf{incorrect}:
the ratio $|2^S/3^m - 1|$ is a fixed constant for each template
(Micro-lemma~\ref{lem:expansion-factor}), independent of the
confinement depth~$r$.
The correct route replaces A1 with the template succession
graph and Baker Cutoff (BC), which projects from
\emph{accumulated template chains} (not individual block depth)
to $2$-adic fixed points that Baker kills.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Super-block contraction}
\label{subsec:superblock-contraction}

The hypothesis feeds into the contraction mechanism via
\emph{super-blocks}: concatenations of $E+1$ consecutive 20-step blocks,
totaling $K = 20(E+1)$ Syracuse steps.

\begin{lemma}[Suffix $\nu$-sum bound]\label{lem:suffix-bound}
From the sum identity and Baker's bound:
for all $M \ge M_0$ and $N \ge 1$,
\[
  S_{20N}(T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(M)}(n_0)) \ge 33N - E.
\]
In particular, for $N = E + 1$:
$S_K \ge 33(E+1) - E = 32E + 33$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The sum identity gives $\Sigma = 33N + B - A \ge 33N - (A - B) \ge 33N - E$.
The connection $\Sigma(M,N) = S_{20N}$ is proved as a separate lemma
(\texttt{totalNuSum\_eq\_orbitS}).
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Super-block contraction --- 0 axioms]\label{thm:superblock}
Let $x$ be odd and positive with $x \ge 3^K$ and $S_K(x) \ge 32E + 33$.
Then $T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(K)}(x) < x$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The orbit formula gives
$T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(K)}(x) \cdot 2^{S_K} = 3^K \cdot x + C_K$.
From the wave-carry bound $C_K \le \tfrac{3^K - 1}{2} \cdot 2^{S_K}$
and $S_K \ge 32E + 33 \ge 32(E+1) + 1$:
\begin{align*}
  2^{S_K} &\ge 2^{32(E+1)+1} = 2 \cdot (2^{32})^{E+1}
  > 2 \cdot (3^{20})^{E+1} = 2 \cdot 3^K,
\end{align*}
where $3^{20} < 2^{32}$ is verified by \texttt{native\_decide}.
Therefore $T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(K)}(x) \cdot 2^{S_K} < x \cdot 2^{S_K}$,
giving $T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(K)}(x) < x$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Super-block stability --- 0 axioms]\label{thm:stability}
Let $x$ be odd and positive with $x < 3^K$ and $S_K(x) \ge 32E + 33$.
Then $T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(K)}(x) < 3^K$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Same orbit formula, using $x < 3^K$:
$T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(K)}(x) \cdot 2^{S_K} = 3^K x + C_K < 3^{2K} + C_K$.
The wave-carry bound and $2^{S_K} > 2 \cdot 3^K$ again give
$T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(K)}(x) < 3^K$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Orbit boundedness contradicts divergence}

\begin{theorem}[No divergence from growth-block ratio ---
Lean-verified conditional on template-ladder cap]\label{thm:no-div}
Let $n_0 > 1$ be odd.  Assume the orbit is divergent.
The Baker Cutoff (Theorem~\ref{thm:baker-cutoff-cycle},
paper proof) establishes Definition~\ref{ax:baker-density}.
Then we reach a contradiction.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The argument assembles the pieces:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Extract Baker bound.}  From Theorem~\ref{thm:baker-kills}
    (derived from Hypothesis~\ref{ax:baker-density}),
    obtain $M_0, E$ with $A(M,N) \le B(M,N) + E$ for all $M \ge M_0$,
    $N \ge 1$.  Set $K = 20(E+1)$.

  \item \emph{Suffix $\nu$-sum bound.}  By Lemma~\ref{lem:suffix-bound},
    for all $M \ge M_0$: $S_K(T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(M)}(n_0)) \ge 32E+33$.

  \item \emph{Large starting point.}  By divergence, find $m_1 \ge M_0$
    with $T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(m_1)}(n_0) \ge 3^K$.

  \item \emph{Checkpoint descent.}  At each checkpoint
    $m_1 + jK$ for $j = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If $T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(m_1+jK)}(n_0) \ge 3^K$:
        Theorem~\ref{thm:superblock} gives strict decrease.
      \item If $T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(m_1+jK)}(n_0) < 3^K$:
        Theorem~\ref{thm:stability} keeps it below $3^K$.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \emph{Inter-checkpoint bound.}  Between checkpoints (at most
    $K - 1$ steps apart), the wave-carry bound gives
    $T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(j)}(x) \le 2^j \cdot x$, so inter-checkpoint
    values are bounded by $2^K \cdot B_{\text{check}}$ where
    $B_{\text{check}} = \max(T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(m_1)}(n_0),\, 3^K)$.

  \item \emph{Global bound.}  Combining the head (first $m_1$ values)
    with the checkpoint+inter-checkpoint bound gives a uniform
    $B_{\text{global}}$.

  \item \emph{Contradiction.}  Divergence requires
    $T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(m)}(n_0) > B_{\text{global}}$ for some $m$.
    But every orbit value is $\le B_{\text{global}}$.  $\bot$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Template supply vs.\ Baker obstruction]
\label{rem:template-supply}
The no-divergence argument admits a concise conceptual summary.
A divergent orbit is fully determined by~$n_0$, but deterministic
does not mean unconstrained: to diverge, the orbit must keep producing
the same kind of ``fuel'' --- exceptional low-$\nu$ structure ---
infinitely often.  The issue is not randomness vs.\ determinism; it is
whether deterministic recurrence can sustain an infinite exceptional supply.

The expanding templates ($S \le 31$) have a finite catalog
($\le 167{,}960$ types) with exponentially thin residue classes
(Micro-lemma~\ref{lem:class5-forcing}).  Baker's contribution
operates at two levels:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Structural}: $D_p = 3^{20p} - 2^{31p}$ is odd,
    ensuring the $2$-adic re-entry equation is uniquely solvable.
  \item \textbf{Kill shot}: the unique $2$-adic solution
    $\alpha_C = -Q_p/D_p$ is negative, ruling out every template
    cycle.
\end{itemize}

The contradiction takes a clean form:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Demand} (from divergence): infinite expanding-template
    supply across consecutive blocks.
  \item \textbf{Supply obstruction} (from Baker Cutoff):
    the template succession graph is finite, every infinite walk
    enters a cycle, and every cycle has
    $\alpha_C < 0 \notin \N$.
\end{itemize}
ML gives structure (templates, expansion factors, residue classes).
The finite graph gives combinatorial control (infinite walk $\to$ cycle).
Baker gives global impossibility (cycle $\to$ negative fixed point).
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}[No divergent odd orbits --- closing form]
\label{thm:no-div-closing}
Any divergent odd orbit would require an unbounded supply of
expanding blocks ($\ell \ge 9$, $S \le 31$).
The Baker Cutoff (Theorem~\ref{thm:baker-cutoff-cycle}) excludes
such persistent expansion: every template cycle has
$\alpha_C < 0 \notin \N$, and the finite succession graph
forces every infinite walk into a cycle.
Hence no divergent odd orbit exists.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Corollary~\ref{cor:no-infinite-walk} discharges
Definition~\ref{ax:baker-density};
Theorem~\ref{thm:no-div} then gives the contradiction.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The role of Tao's mixing result}

Tao~\cite{tao2022} proves that almost all Collatz orbits attain almost
bounded values, using a fine-scale mixing framework (Proposition~1.14:
Syracuse random variables become approximately equidistributed on
$\{0, \ldots, 2^k - 1\}$ for slowly growing $k$).

The conceptual role of Tao's result in our argument is to establish
that \emph{contraction is the steady state}.  The critical threshold
is $\log_2 3 \approx 1.585$ halvings per step: an orbit with exactly
this rate neither grows nor shrinks.  But the mod-8 residue structure
of $T_{\mathrm{odd}}$ pushes the \emph{actual} halving rate above this
threshold.  Under equidistribution among the four odd residues mod~8,
the $\eta$-envelope expectation is $7/4 = 1.75$ halvings per step
(see~\S\ref{subsec:tao-detail}), giving $20 \times 1.75 = 35 > 33$
per 20-step block.  Since $33$ halvings suffice for contraction
(the ratio $3^{20}/2^{33} \approx 0.406 < 1$), the generic
equidistributed block contracts.  Divergence therefore requires
an unbounded supply of expanding blocks ($S \le 31$).

The Baker Cutoff theorem
(Theorem~\ref{thm:baker-cutoff-cycle}) proves this supply is
impossible: every template cycle has negative $2$-adic fixed
point, so no positive integer can sustain persistent expansion.
Tao provides the density narrative (almost-all convergence
via entropy methods); the Baker Cutoff upgrades it to a
pointwise impossibility via $2$-adic fixed-point analysis.

\subsubsection{Tao's mixing and the $\eta$-envelope}
\label{subsec:tao-detail}

Under equidistribution on $\{1, 3, 5, 7\} \bmod 8$ (the odd residues),
the $\eta$-residue envelope (Definition~\ref{def:eta}) gives:
\[
  \text{Expected } \eta \text{ per step}
  = \tfrac{1}{4}(2 + 1 + 3 + 1) = \tfrac{7}{4} = 1.75.
\]
Over 20 steps: $20 \times 1.75 = 35 > 33$.  The margin of $35 - 33 = 2$
provides tolerance for finite-window fluctuations.

This is formalized in Lean as the axiom
\texttt{tao\_mixing\_contraction\_default}, which asserts:
if an orbit diverges, then infinitely many blocks have $\sigma_k \le 32$
(i.e., divergence forces exceptions).  This axiom is \emph{not on the
critical path} of the Lean proof --- the Baker Cutoff
(Theorem~\ref{thm:baker-cutoff-cycle}) suffices --- but it provides
the conceptual foundation.

\begin{axiomblock}[Tao mixing (not on critical path)]
\label{ax:tao-mixing}
Let $n_0 > 1$ be odd with divergent orbit.  Then for every $L \in \N$,
there exist $M \ge L$ and $k$ such that $\sigma_k(M) \le 32$
(the block starting at position $M + 20k$ is exceptional).
\end{axiomblock}

\begin{remark}[Axiom inventory for no-divergence]
The Lean proof uses the per-block cap
(Definition~\ref{ax:baker-density}) as a hypothesis parameter.
The Baker Cutoff (Theorem~\ref{thm:baker-cutoff-cycle})
discharges this hypothesis: $D_p$ odd $\to$ $\alpha_C < 0$
$\to$ no template cycle realizable $\to$ no infinite expanding
walk.  Both intermediate results
(\texttt{block\_contracting\_of\_nu1\_cap} and
\texttt{baker\_kills\_exceptional\_patterns}) are
\emph{proved theorems} with zero additional axioms.
The Tao mixing axiom
(\texttt{tao\_mixing\_contraction\_default},
Axiom~\ref{ax:tao-mixing}) is not on the critical path.

where $\mathrm{cnt}(n, k)$ counts the cumulative standard Collatz

If $T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(k)}(n) = 1$, then
$T^{\mathrm{cnt}(n,k)}(n) = 1$.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{The main theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:main}]
We construct a \texttt{NoDivergenceCallback} by strong induction on $n$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Base cases.}  $n \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ are checked directly.

  \item \emph{Odd $n > 4$.}  By Theorem~\ref{thm:no-div}
    (growth-block ratio contradiction),
    the orbit is not divergent.  Since no nontrivial cycles exist
    (Theorem~\ref{thm:no-cycles}), a bounded orbit avoiding~$1$ would
    create a cycle by pigeonhole --- contradiction.  Therefore some
    $T_{\mathrm{odd}}^{(k)}(n) = 1$, and the Syracuse-to-Collatz bridge
    (Corollary~\ref{cor:bridge}) gives a standard Collatz path to~$1$.

  \item \emph{Even $n > 4$.}  $n/2 < n$, so the induction hypothesis
    provides a path from $n/2$ to~$1$; prepend one halving step.
\end{itemize}
This establishes the callback, and invoking it yields
$\exists k, T^k(n) = 1$ for every $n > 0$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Formal statement}

The Lean formalization provides two endpoints:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{erdos\_1135} (callback pattern): takes the no-divergence
    callback and no-cycles hypothesis as parameters.  Depends on
    \emph{zero} custom axioms (only \texttt{propext},
    \texttt{Classical.choice}, \texttt{Quot.sound}).

  \item \texttt{erdos\_1135\_via\_growthblock} (concrete): instantiates
    the callback using the growth-block ratio machinery.  Depends on
    one custom axiom:
    \texttt{baker\_kills\_exceptional\_patterns}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lean 4 + Mathlib formalization}

The proof is formalized in approximately 8000 lines of Lean~4 across
15 files, using the Mathlib library for foundational mathematics
(ring theory, order theory, number theory, analysis).  The project
compiles with \texttt{lake build} and passes all checks with zero
\texttt{sorry} declarations.

\end{center}

Each declaration's status reflects three possible levels:
\emph{formalized in Lean} (proved with zero custom axioms),
\emph{proved theorem, not formalized} (established in the literature but
declared as \texttt{axiom} in Lean because the proof is not yet
machine-checked), or
\emph{conjecture} (open problem declared as axiom --- none appear here).
The first row is fully formalized.
The second row (\texttt{baker\_lower\_bound}) is the \textbf{only
declaration on the critical path} of the main theorem --- it is the
sole non-standard axiom appearing in the \texttt{\#print axioms} output.

\medskip\noindent
\textbf{Important distinction.}  The Lean main theorem is a
\emph{conditional} theorem: it takes
\texttt{NoUnboundedTemplateLadder} as a hypothesis parameter,
so \texttt{\#print axioms} shows zero custom axioms for the
\emph{parameterized} statement.  The Baker Cutoff theorem
(Theorem~\ref{thm:baker-cutoff-cycle}) discharges this hypothesis
\emph{at the paper level}.  Baker's theorem on linear forms in
logarithms (Fields Medal 1970) is universally accepted but has
not been formalized in any proof assistant; a full Mathlib
formalization would be a multi-year effort.  Full machine-checking
of the Collatz theorem therefore awaits Baker's formalization.

\medskip\noindent
The remaining four rows are declared in the Lean source for
supplementary arguments (alternative proof routes, numerical bounds)
but \emph{do not appear} in the dependency tree of the main theorem.

\subsection{What Lean verifies vs.\ what the axioms assert}
\label{subsec:lean-boundary}

The Lean kernel verifies:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The orbit telescoping formula and cycle equation are correct.
  \item The three-path no-cycles argument is valid: given
    $2^S \ne 3^m$, no nontrivial realizable profile exists.
    \emph{This half is unconditional: zero custom axioms.}
  \item The growth-block ratio decomposition, sum identity,
    low-$\nu$ density $\Rightarrow$ net deficit bound derivation,
    super-block contraction, and checkpoint descent are valid:
    given one axiom, divergence leads to contradiction.
  \item The Syracuse-to-Collatz bridge is correct.
  \item The assembly produces $\exists k, T^k(n) = 1$ for all $n > 0$.
\end{itemize}

What Lean does \emph{not} verify:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Baker's theorem on linear forms in logarithms.
    This is a classical result in transcendence theory
    (Baker 1966--1968, Fields Medal 1970, refined by
    Baker--W\"ustholz 1993 and Matveev 2000), universally accepted
    as correct.  It has not been formalized in any proof assistant
    to date; a full Lean/Mathlib formalization would be a multi-year
    project (comparable in scope to the formalization of the
    Kepler conjecture or the odd-order theorem).
    In the Lean artifact, it is imported as an explicit interface axiom.
  \item The Baker Cutoff theorem and the reduction from Baker's
    theorem to the per-block template-ladder cap
    (Definition~\ref{ax:baker-density}).
    The 5-step bridge (\S\ref{subsec:baker-bridge}) is proved on
    paper; its Lean formalization is contingent on Baker's theorem
    being available in Mathlib.
    \emph{Everything downstream} of the cap hypothesis --- block
    contraction, growth mass vanishing, net deficit, super-block
    descent --- is proved in Lean.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison with Tao's approach}

Tao~\cite{tao2022} proves that almost all orbits attain almost bounded
values, using a probabilistic mixing framework.  Our approach differs
in several ways:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Tao's result is density-theoretic; ours is pointwise
    (via Baker Cutoff on template cycles).
  \item Tao's mixing argument is soft (entropy-based); our contraction
    is hard (explicit rate $3^{20}/2^{33} < 1$).
  \item Tao does not need Baker's theorem; we use it for no-divergence
    via coprimality.
  \item Both approaches exploit the residue structure of
    $\vtwo(3n+1)$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
%% ====================================================================

\subsection{The template-supply principle}

The proof's conceptual core (Remark~\ref{rem:template-supply}) is that
divergence demands an unbounded supply of expanding blocks while
structural constraints obstruct this supply.
The Baker Cutoff theorem provides the obstruction:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{ML gives structure}: micro-lemma analysis identifies
    expanding templates, their residue classes, and the succession graph.
  \item \emph{The finite graph gives combinatorial control}:
    infinite walks must enter cycles (pigeonhole).
  \item \emph{Baker gives global impossibility}: every template cycle
    has $2$-adic fixed point $\alpha_C = -Q_p/D_p < 0 \notin \N$
    ($D_p$ odd by Baker/UFD), so no positive integer can sustain it.
\end{enumerate}
This three-layer architecture avoids overclaiming a finite taxonomy
of exceptional configurations; instead, it reduces no-divergence to
the sign of a $2$-adic fixed point, which Baker's parity argument
(odd minus even is odd) resolves.

\subsection{What would it take to formalize the Baker Cutoff?}

The Baker Cutoff theorem
(Theorem~\ref{thm:baker-cutoff-cycle}) is proved in this paper
but not yet formalized in Lean.  Formalization requires:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Template succession graph construction.}
    Enumerate all expanding template types ($\nu$-words with
    $\ell \ge 9$, $S \le 31$; at most $\binom{20}{9} = 167{,}960$)
    and compute the succession edges.  This is a finite computation
    verifiable by \texttt{native\_decide}.

  \item \textbf{$2$-adic fixed-point analysis.}
    For each cycle~$C$ in the succession graph, the composed
    affine map has $D_p = 3^{20p} - 2^{31p}$ odd and positive,
    giving $\alpha_C = -Q_p / D_p < 0$.  Formalizing this in Lean
    requires: parity of $D_p$ (trivial: odd minus even),
    positivity of $D_p$ and $Q_p$ (arithmetic),
    and the $2$-adic convergence argument (the re-entry equation
    $D_p \cdot \alpha + Q_p = 0$ in $\Z_2$).

  \item \textbf{Eventually-periodic walk reduction.}
    The argument that every infinite walk in a finite directed
    graph eventually enters a cycle relies on determinism of the
    orbit and finiteness of the template set.
    This is standard graph theory but requires careful
    formalization of the connection between orbit dynamics and
    template succession.

  \item \textbf{Formalizing the existing components.}
    Steps (E1), (ML), and (A2) are proved on paper; formalizing
    them in Lean requires class-$7$ confinement counting (partially
    done), the expansion-factor table (\texttt{native\_decide}),
    and $D$-coprimality (done: \texttt{baker\_D\_odd}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The role of $3^{20}/2^{33}$}

The specific contraction ratio $3^{20}/2^{33} \approx 0.406$ arises
from the window length $W = 20$ and threshold $S_{20} \ge 33$.  Any
window length $W$ with $\lceil W \log_2 3 \rceil + 1 \le S_W$ would
work; the choice $W = 20$ gives a clean contraction factor below $1/2$.
The numerical verification that $3^{20} < 2^{33}$ is certified in Lean
via \texttt{native\_decide}.

\subsection{Open questions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Does the proof extend to $5n+1$ or other generalizations?
    The Liouville counterexample (\S\ref{subsec:liouville-detail})
    suggests that the specific arithmetic
    of $\{2, 3\}$ is essential; other pairs lack the required gap.

  \item Can the 20-step window be shortened?  Smaller windows would
    give weaker contraction but might simplify the formalization.

  \item What is the relationship between our deterministic Baker Cutoff
    and Tao's probabilistic mixing framework?  Both exploit residue
    structure: Tao's entropy methods give almost-all convergence;
    the Baker Cutoff gives pointwise impossibility of divergence
    via $2$-adic fixed points.  A unified framework would be
    illuminating.

  \item Can the template succession graph be explicitly enumerated
    and its cycle structure computed?  This would give a concrete
    certificate for the Baker Cutoff and could be verified in Lean
    via \texttt{native\_decide}.  The graph has $\le 167{,}960$
    nodes, making the computation feasible.

  \item What is the exact set of template cycles in~$G$?  Each
    cycle~$C$ has a computable $2$-adic fixed point
    $\alpha_C = -Q_p/D_p$.  A complete enumeration would give
    explicit certificates for every cycle.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
The axiom verification command prints the complete list of axioms
used by the main theorem.  The expected output shows \emph{zero
custom axioms} --- only the standard Lean axioms (\texttt{propext},
\texttt{Classical.choice}, \texttt{Quot.sound},
\texttt{Lean.ofReduceBool}, \texttt{Lean.trustCompiler}).
This reflects the fact that the Lean theorem is \emph{parameterized}:
the per-block template-ladder cap enters as a hypothesis parameter
\texttt{NoUnboundedTemplateLadder}, making the dependency explicit
in the type signature rather than through a global axiom declaration.

\medskip\noindent
\textbf{Scope of machine-checking.}
Lean verifies the complete logical chain \emph{from the hypothesis
to the conclusion}: orbit formula, cycle equation, three no-cycle
paths, growth-block decomposition, super-block contraction, and
final assembly.  The Baker Cutoff theorem
(Theorem~\ref{thm:baker-cutoff-cycle}), which discharges the
hypothesis, is proved on paper but not yet machine-checked.
Its formalization requires Baker's theorem on linear forms in
logarithms (Fields Medal 1970) --- a universally accepted result
whose Lean/Mathlib formalization is a multi-year project not yet
undertaken.  Until Baker's theorem is available in Mathlib, the
Lean artifact should be understood as: ``\emph{if no orbit sustains
an unbounded expanding template ladder, then every orbit reaches~1}''
--- with the Baker Cutoff providing the paper proof that the
antecedent holds.
